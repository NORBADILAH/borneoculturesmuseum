                <h2>WORKSHOPS AND CLASSES </h2>
                <p>
                    Workshops and classes are hands-on educational programs designed to engage visitors by allowing them to actively participate in learning activities related to the museum's exhibits. These programs provide a deeper, more immersive experience, enabling participants to explore specific themes or skills in an interactive way. For example, in art museums,workshops and classes might involve painting, drawing, or sculpture-making, while science museums might offer hands-on experiments or demonstrations. These programs allow visitors to create something themselves or engage with concepts in a tangible way, which enhances their understanding and enjoyment of the museum’s collections. Whether it's learning about art techniques, scientific principles, or historical practices, workshops and classes are designed to make learning fun and accessible for a variety of ages and skill levels.

                <p>
                    Guided tours are special tours led by friendly and knowledgeable staff, like educators or curators, who share their expertise to help visitors better understand and appreciate the museum’s exhibits.

                <h2>COMMUNITY OUTREACH PROGRAMS</h2>
                <p>
                    Community outreach programs are efforts by museums to bring their educational and cultural experiences to people outside the museum’s walls. Instead of just waiting for visitors to come to the museum, these programs take exhibits, workshops, and events into schools, libraries, community centers, and other local spaces. The goal is to make the museum’s resources available to everyone, especially those who might not be able to visit in person. These programs help connect the museum with the community, making it a part of daily life. Whether it's hosting a fun event, offering educational materials, or simply sharing knowledge, community outreach programs ensure that more people have the chance to learn and grow through the museum’s offerings.
