                    <h2>EDUCATIONAL RESOURCES</h2>
                    <p>
                        Educational resources are tools that museums offer to help visitors learn more about what’s on display. They’re perfect for students, teachers, or anyone who’s curious and wants to dive deeper into the museum’s collections. Examples of educational resources include lesson plans and activity sheets that teachers can use to bring the exhibits to life in the classroom. Some museums also provide videos or short documentaries that explain the history behind their displays. For those who prefer learning online, many museums offer interactive tools like quizzes, games, and virtual tours to make learning fun and engaging.

                    <h2>VIRTUAL TOURS</h2>
                    <p>
                        Virtual tours have become a great way for people to experience museums without having to leave home. These online experiences allow visitors to explore exhibits and galleries in a way that feels almost like being there in person. With 360-degree views, you can move through different rooms and get up close to the artwork or artifacts, even zooming in to see the finer details. Many virtual tours also include helpful guides, either through audio or text, so you can learn more about what you're seeing. Some museums take it a step further by live-streaming events like talks or performances, giving you a front-row seat to special happenings. For people who can’t make it to the museum in person—whether due to distance, mobility issues, or other reasons—virtual tours offer a wonderful way to explore and engage with the museum’s collections. It’s a simple, yet powerful way to bring art, history, and culture to anyone, no matter where they are.

                    <h2>SOCIAL MEDIA ENGAGEMENT </h2>
                    <p>
                        Social media engagement is a great way for museums to stay connected with their visitors and share what’s going on. Through platforms like Facebook, Instagram, and Twitter, museums can update their audience about new exhibits, events, or programs. They can also share fun behind-the-scenes moments, like setting up a new show or showing interesting details about their collections. Museums often interact with followers by asking questions, sharing polls, or hosting contests to keep things interesting. Some even do live videos or Q&A sessions, allowing people to engage in real-time and get a closer look at exhibits or events. Social media engagement helps museums stay in touch with their community, making it easier for people to keep up with what’s happening, share their own experiences, and feel more connected to the museum.
