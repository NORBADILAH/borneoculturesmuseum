            <p>The Female Figures from the Bidayuh Peoples are traditional wooden carvings created by the Bidayuh people of Borneo, often representing women in their culture. These figures are typically used in ceremonies and rituals to symbolize fertility, femininity, and protection. The carvings feature exaggerated traits like prominent breasts and wide hips, emphasizing the importance of women in community life, particularly in roles related to fertility and family well-being.<br>

            These figures hold significant cultural and spiritual value, as they are seen as representations of the vital role women play in maintaining the continuity of the community. The Female Figures serve not only as artistic pieces but also as symbols of respect for women, invoking blessings for prosperity and fertility. They are a key element of Bidayuh heritage, helping to preserve the community's traditions and beliefs.</p>
